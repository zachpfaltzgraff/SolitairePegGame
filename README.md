About Peg Solitaire
-------------------
Peg solitaire (or Solo Noble) is a single player board game involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. In the United Kingdom the game is referred to as Solitaire while the card games are called Patience. The game is also known as Brainvita (especially in India). The first evidence of the game can be traced back to 1697.  More: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire

Game Rules
----------
The rules of Peg solitaire are simple, A peg can jump over another peg as long as there is an empty hole on the other side.  Once a peg has been jumped over, it is removed from the board.  

The game starts with all the holes on the board filled with a peg except the hole in the center, which is empty. The first move begins with a peg jumping over another peg into an empty hole. A peg can jump left, right, up or down but cannot jump diagonally.  A peg can only jump one peg at a time, but as with Checkers, a peg can make a series of multiple jumps if there are open holes. Play continues with a peg jumping over another peg into an empty hole until there are no possible moves left.

Winning the game.
-----------------
The game is won when all of the pegs are removed except one.
